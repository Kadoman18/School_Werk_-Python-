List vs Tuple

Ok. So this is going to be tricky to get to 150 words but I will do it haha (excluding this bit).
A list is a collection of variables that maintains its order but is mutable. This means that you
can call an index and every single time it will return the same variable from your list so long 
as you, dont change it (maintains its order), however, you do have the OPTION to change the
variables in your list. Lists are made by using square brackets [] (which are also be used to
make a dictionary). A tuple is similar to a list in that it also maintains its order, however,
tuples are immutable. This means that once you declare a variable in your tuple, you can not
change it. Because of this, tuples are good for things like city names, distances, conversions,
etc. Things you will never need to change. In most situations, I feel, a list is perfectly fine
to be used, so long as you know that the objects are mutable and are careful not to do so
unintentionally, but like I said, if you are making a collection of variables that will not
need to be changed, A tuple is what should be used.
