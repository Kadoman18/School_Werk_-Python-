F Strings

F strings are freaking fantastic. An f string is a string that is prefixed with
an f (ex. f'string goes here') and the reason this is fantastic is that when you
are using an f string you are enabled to use curly brackets to insert variables
into your string to be printed out. So lets say I had a variable called addition
that took two inputs (lets call them number1 and number2) and added them together.
This is a simple example where an f string can shine, If I were to write a line
after the inputs that read:
"print(f'The sum of {number1} and {number2} is {number1 + number2}.')"
Then for whatever numbers you put in in those first two input
prompts (lets say 5 and 7), the console would print "The sum of 5 and 7 is 12".
F strings allow you to use variables IN strings in a way that doesnt require
any convoluted pluses or commas, it helps keep code readable.
