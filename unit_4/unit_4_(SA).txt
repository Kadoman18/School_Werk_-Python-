It is possible to nest if conditions inside other if conditions.
Why should you limit how deeply you nest if sequences?
Search the internet for arguments.

I have watched a lot of videos about this personally and think I should be able to answer
this on my own but will do research afterwards regardless. From what I understand, if
statements, in any languange, can be confusing. The nature of nested if statements expecially.
So as a programmer, it is important that we keep our code readable and maintainable. If someone
else was looking at my code and found a 6 deep nested if statement, they would probably have
a difficult time understanding the nature of the conditions (especially if there is math involved).
And so, reason one is: readability/maintainance. Easy to read code is easy to upkeep. The other
reasons I have found in my 'hobbyist' research, are less important, such as: cleanliness. A lot
of programmers have said that when they get past a certain number of indents, they start to feel
like their code looks icky. I lastly will talk about system resources. From what I understand,
which is not much at all, if statements are more resource intensive than just simple declarations.
So when possible, avoiding nesting if statements is reccomended simply for simplicity, and
resource managment.
